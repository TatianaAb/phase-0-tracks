I will look up in Google for jQuery tutorial and quickly go trough them to choose the most comprehensive and clear material. I will probably choose one of the trusted sources like tutorial point or w3school. I will definitely time box.

I've chosen w3school as it seemed more cleared for me. And time boxing is great strategy to use.
